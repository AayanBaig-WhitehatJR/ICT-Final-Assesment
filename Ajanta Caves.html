    <h3>
    What are Ajanta Caves?
    <br>
  The Ajanta Caves are approximately <b> <i>rock-cut Buddhist cave monuments</i></b> which date from the 2nd century BCE to about 480 CE in Aurangabad district of Maharashtra state of India. 
    <br>
    The Ajanta Caves constitute ancient monasteries and worship-halls of different Buddhist traditions carved into a 75-metre (246 ft) wall of rock. The caves also present paintings depicting the past lives and rebirths of the Buddha, pictorial tales from Aryasura's Jatakamala, and rock-cut sculptures of Buddhist deities.

<h3>
    Who built the Ajanta Caves? 
    <br>
    20 caves were built during the Vakataka dynasty, during the reign of Harisena, and at the end of his reign, these caves were abandoned. Inside the caves, you can see paintings depicting the life of Gautam Buddha, and also stories from Jataka Tales.

<h3>
In 1682, the current ruler of the Mughal Dynasty, Aurangzeb, hired over 1000 workers for three years only to destroy this temple, completely.
<br>
But, to his surprise, the cave would not collapse down. It was unbreakable. They only chipped a few parts. Eventually, Aurangzeb gave up and left the caves as it is, with the chips still there till this date.
